#Contribute to Arch Linux Women

Arch Linux Women is community driven, and without contributions, the project
will die. Even small contributions add up to something great, so please get
involved where you can. There are a ton of ways that both new and old members
can contribute, and you don't have to be a programmer or have large amounts of
free time to help.

##Tell others about the project

If you know any women who use Linux, or even just might be interested in
learning, tell them about our project. Mention us in one of your social media
updates or make a blog post about our organization. Print out some of our flyers
and post them up around your College CS lab. The first step to getting more
people involved with Arch Linux Women, is telling them about Arch Linux Women.

##Chat in our IRC channels

Arch Women has two IRC channels on '''irc.freenode.net''' - '''#archlinux-women''' and
'''#archlinux-women-dev'''. Before joining in read the channel rules
and community standards. Our main chat is used for networking, learning and
discussion. Our developement chat is used for Arch Women project developement,
such as the IRC bot, the website, and server tools. You can jump in there to see
our git commits and learn how things are done "behind the scenes".
